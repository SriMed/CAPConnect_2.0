# CAPConnect

CAPConnect stands for Civil Action Project Connect. It connects potential volunteers to existing campaigns, encouraging civic engagement among individuals of all ages, especially youth. If users wish to create their own campaign, the app connects them with resources to get started.

The app allows users to create a profile that stores their interests. An elastic search based upon their interests results in local campaigns. Users may then select a campaign to learn more information and sign up for volunteer opportunities. Other relevant information about the campaign including contact information, events, etc. is also made available to the user. If the issue they wish to advocate for does not have an existing campaign, they may create a campaign. Based upon their location, the app finds local and national representatives. Contact information for the representatives such as email address, phone number and social media is made available. Campaign creation also includes sample emails and social media posts. The organizer can also manage volunteer lists and create events for their cause.
